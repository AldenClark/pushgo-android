# Release Notes

This file contains end-user-facing release notes for Google Play and GitHub Releases.

Policy:
- Beta tags use `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, and read from `[Unreleased]`.
- Release tags use `vX.Y.Z`, and read from `[vX.Y.Z]`.
- Keep entries user-visible and outcome-focused.
- Internal refactors, CI changes, and implementation details belong in `release/CHANGELOG.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed Android in-app update checks so signed update feeds verify correctly again.
- Fixed update prompts so release notes appear again when a new version is detected.
