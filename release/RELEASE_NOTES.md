# Release Notes

This file contains end-user-facing release notes for Google Play and GitHub Releases.

Policy:
- Beta tags use `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, and read from `[Unreleased]`.
- Release tags use `vX.Y.Z`, and read from `[vX.Y.Z]`.
- Keep entries user-visible and outcome-focused.
- Internal refactors, CI changes, and implementation details belong in `release/CHANGELOG.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed Android update install-blocked flow so users now get an in-app error alert immediately.
- Fixed blocked-install fallback so users can continue via Android system installer in one tap.
